/**
 *  @example rpcmsg_generation.c
 *	This example will show how to generate a RPC messages with the functions generateHTTPHeader
 *  and generateXML
 *
 *  A RPC message consists of two parts an HTTP Header, telling receiver information about
 *  the other side and a xml message.
 *
 *  For generating such a message there are two functions \ref generateHTTPHeader and \ref generateXML.
 *
 *  The most usefull tags or strings needed for interacting with a server are already predefined,
 *  but sometimes it might be necessary to have additional strings which are inserted into
 *  the message.
 *
 *  For this custom string arrays can be generated, either one for each function or one for both functions.
 *  In this example we are using seperate arrays:
 *
 *  \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Generating arrays for custom strings
 *
 *	As seen here the arrays can be constant arrays or not. But both functions normally require
 *	const char**, otherwise a compiler warning is generated when compiling the code. To
 *	surpress the warning my insert a cast like here:
 *
 *	\snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Generating the Header
 *
 *	For storing the header and the message for later usage, it's necessary to have output buffers:
 *
 *	\snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Creating the buffers
 *
 *	First of all the XML message has to be generated, because the header generator needs to know it's
 *	size for the Content-Length parameter.
 *
 *	For the header and message generation we use command arrays. Command arrays are integer arrays
 *	holding specific commands for the generator. They can contain each tag as often as they won't,
 *	while the string for the tag itself is only stored once. This is necessary because many platforms
 *	like microcontrollers do not offer much memory, often less than a megabyte.
 *
 *	The command sets for the XML generator and Header Generator differ because according to the HTTP
 *	standard a header field is closed with a line feed and can't be nested, while XML tags are closed
 *	by a closing tag and allow nesting.
 *
 * The next snippet shows the generator commands for the XML generator.
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Commands for the XML generation
 *
 * As you can see it's a array of the type \ref ros_rpc_gen_command which is a enum type and should be
 * translated to integer.
 *
 * The array starts with \ref RPC_XML_DECLARATION, which inserts the string
 * \verbatim<?xml version="1.0" ?>\endverbatim
 *
 * We skip the first open tag \verbatim<methodcall>\endverbatim which is created by \ref RPC_TAG_METHODCALL
 * and look at the next tag \verbatim<methodname>\endverbatim created by \ref RPC_TAG_METHODNAME
 * because it's more suitable for the explanation.
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Standard Tag and Text
 *
 * As seen RPC_TAG_ commands create a open standard tag. The following command \ref RPC_STDTEXT_HASPARAM,
 * creates the standard string hasParam. To close a tag it's necessary to call the same command again but
 * place the \ref RPC_CT macro infront of it. As seen in the last snippet.
 *
 * In the next snippet we see the the usage of custom tags and texts and the generation of a string of a number.
 *  *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Custom Tag and Text
 *
 * To create a tag which uses a string out of the custom string array, \ref RPC_CUSTOM_TAG used and added
 * to a number, the number specifies the string which will be used to created the tag. Closing the
 * tag works the same like for standard tags by adding a \ref RPC_CT in front of it.
 *
 * The \ref RPC_CUSTOM_TEXT command works like the same as the \ref RPC_CUSTOM_TAG command. The
 * only difference is, that the string is directly inserted into the message without brackets.
 *
 * Another feature, executed with command \ref RPC_UINT_NUMBER allows to place different
 * unsigned integers into the message. The integer to be printed must be added to the command.
 *
 * Now we call the generateXML function and store it's return value, which is the message length,
 * into a variable.
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c generating XML
 *
 * As mentioned before, the message length is needed for creating the header,so it can be created now.
 *
 * The next snippet shows the array of the type \ref http_head_gen_command.
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Commands for the header generation
 *
 * The usage of the header generation commands is nearly the same as those for XML generation.
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Standard header descriptor and value
 *
 * The commands beginning with HTTP_HEADER_GEN_ like  HTTP_HEADER_GEN_DESC_USER_AGENT generate
 * header descriptors ending with a double point ("User-Agent:"). While commands beginning
 * HTTP_HEADER_GEN_VAL_ like  HTTP_HEADER_GEN_VAL_XMLRPC_ROSC_NODELIB create string values
 * ending with a line feed ("XMLRPC ROSc-NodeLib").
 *
 * Custom descriptors and values are created with HTTP_HEADER_GEN_DESC_CUSTOM and
 * HTTP_HEADER_GEN_VAL_CUSTOM.
 *
 * As seen in the next snippet they work the same like their pendants for the XML generator.
 * But if using a non standard text HTTP_HEADER_GEN_VAL_CUSTOM or the string from integer
 * command HTTP_HEADER_GEN_VAL_UINT_NUMBER, it's necessary to add a HTTP_HEADER_GEN_CUSTOM_TEXT_END,
 * to the end for creating a new line.
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Custom header descriptor and value
 *
 * To generate the header the function \ref generateHTTPHeader is called and the return value,
 * which is also the length, stored in another variable.
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Generating the Header
 *
 * At the end this examples prints the strings of header and message. Which are not terminated!
 *
 * \snippet examples/rpcmsg_generation.c Just Printing
 *
 *  \par Output:
 \verbatim
 User-Agent: XMLRPC ROSc-NodeLib
 Host: http://myHost:11311
 Content-Type: text/xml
 Content-length: 150
 custom_desc: custom_val

 <?xml version="1.0"?><methodcall><methodname>hasParam</methodname><params><param><custom_tag>custom_text900</custom_tag></param></params></methodcall>\endverbatim
