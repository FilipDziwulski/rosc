ROSc Subscribing Submarine (released 11.12.13)

\section Project State

\warning This is an early alpha release, expect heavy changes.

\section Roadmap
	
- Fix bugs inside ROS subscriber/publisher
- Create test functions for ROS subscriber/publisher
- Finalize Abstraction Layer
- Implement Parameters
- Implement Services

\section errata Known Errors and Missing Features

\subsection Nested Messages
There is one or more Bugs in the binary message subscriber (maybe also publisher), when it comes to nested messages or dynamic arrays.
So you should not use them right now.

\subsection abstraction Hardware OS Abstraction Layer

At the moment ROSc is Linux only. The functions have been prepared 
to be used in a event based system, but the final form
of this abstraction layer is still missing.

\subsection Services Services
Services are not implemented so far.

\subsection Parameter Parameter Interface
Parameter Interface is also not implemented.
